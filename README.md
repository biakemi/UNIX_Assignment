# UNIX_Assignment
UNIX assignment repository

###Cloning the git repository
1. `$git clone https://github.com/biakemi/UNIX_Assignment.git`
2. I added the files to the repository and checked the status by typing `$git status`
3. The files I moved to the repository were marked as "untracked files" - so I staged the files  `$git add`
4. By typing `$git status` again, I checked that all files were staged
